<!-- INTRO: For this project I decided to make a website to go along with a instagram account I run, 
  @mossyrockofficial! The whole concept is a bit of a joke that I decided to run with. It's based
  around the idea of a small but dedicated community of moss enthusiasts in Northern Ontario. So 
  this site was made in humor and as a bit of an add-on for the instagram page, to add a little
  life to this idea that I find kind of fun :)

<h5>Really nice mossy rock I saw the other day</h5>
<h3>May 25, 2007</h3>
<p>Check it out guys! Saw this beauty the other day in what felt like a once-in-a-lifetime encounter. So I was walking through the woods near the Misema River area and stumbled on this stunner. What a thrill! I know we usually cast votes for the annual calendar assignments but this one is going right in for May. I would say I don't make the rules but i totally do lol</p>

  <h5>A real stunner</h5>
  <h3>May 09, 2007</h3>
  <p>Here it is folks: the beauty we've all been talking about since the MossWalk! Ain't she pretty? I'm calling this moss to be part of the greater <i>bryophyta</i> family, although its hard to say for sure. Derry says its a granite for sure, although I'm not sure how one identifies geology when the rock itself isn't visible. Either way, it's quite a combo! We will surely note this one down in the directory to pass by on future hikes. </p>

  <h5>Community Notice</h5>
  <h3>May 11, 2007</h3>
  <p>Just a note to the MRFC members who attended the MossWalk last weekend at the Kirkland Lake Microbotany Conservation Area: Keith unfortunately lost his antique magnifying glass while walking the trails. Anyone happening to return to the KLMBCA any time soon is requested to keep an eye out so we can return Keith's family heirloom. We all know how disappointed his father would have been if he were alive to witness his son's biggest failure.</p>
  <p>If found please call Ken at 615-2112 and drop it off in the KLMBCA office in an envelope labelled "Kieth's Reason for Living".</p>

  <h5>A Call to Moss ID Pros!</h5>
  <h3>April 29, 2007</h3>
  <p>And we're back for another fine season of moss hunting and rock identification! The MRN Norther Ontario Division started off our season with a little meetup at Bill Harland's place in along the Blanche for a seasonal refresher on moss ID. We found this gen pretty close to the shore of the Misema River - anybody familiar? We we're all pretty enthralled, but no dice on ID so far!</p><p>Anyone with specific knowledge on this guy can reach out to Ken on his cell, please and thank you!</p>

  <h5>A note to MRN members</h5>
  <h3>November 7, 2006</h3>
  <p>Just a note for member from admin Ken. And I can't believe I have to go over this again. Lichens are NOT the same thing as mosses. We had a great season this year, but come 2007 PLEASE limit your content to moss and/or mossy rock related stuff ONLY. We don't "lichen shame" here, but come on. There's a time and place.</p>
  <p>Cheers and see all you folks next season!</p>

  <h5>Another Successful MRN Meetup</h5>
  <h3>October 28, 2006</h3>
  <p>Thanks to all who came out to the Northern Ontario MossWalk this Sunday! New member Lee gave us a lovely tour of their favorite mossy rocks in Lady Evelyn Smoothwater Provincial Park, and I think we're all pretty excited to have them as part of the crew.</p>
  <p>Lee, you're welcome to join us any time.</p>
  <p>He're's just a sneak peek of the shots we got from LESPP: who doesn't love a little mossy lump next to a beautiful babbling brook?</p>
